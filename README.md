This challenged us to use a new data analytics tool to create visualizations of the NYC Citibike data from 2019. The visualizations explain popular locations for bikers, genders, times and other data that can teach viewers.
## Results
![Checkout Times by Gender](https://github.com/rindneremily/bikeshare/blob/main/images/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)
Checkout Times by Gender shows how long each bike users trip lasts based on gender. This compares genders male, female, and unknown and how long their trips are once the bike is checked out.
![Checkout Times for Users](https://github.com/rindneremily/bikeshare/blob/main/images/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.png)
Checkout Times for Users shows the popular times to use the bikes and typically how long the bike trip lasts once it's checked out. It is similar to the Checkout Times by Gender visual but does not specify the gender of the biker. It is a broader visualization. This focuses on customer type.
![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](https://github.com/rindneremily/bikeshare/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)
Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) is a heat map showing the typical length of a bike trip based on gender and time. The darker colors show the length of time.
![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://github.com/rindneremily/bikeshare/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)
Trips by Weekday per Hour is a similar visualization to the one prior but does not focus on gender. It is broader but has the similar pattern with the relationship between the length of the bike trip and time.
![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/rindneremily/bikeshare/blob/main/images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)
User Trips by Gender by Weekday is a heat map specializing in the relationship between trip, gender, and time. The main idea is to compare the customer type with the gender and weekday of usage.
![Challenge Story 5:7](https://github.com/rindneremily/bikeshare/blob/main/images/Challenge%20Story%205:7.png)
This story is a combination of the six sheets created in the challenge. By combining them all into one story it gives the reader a concise view of the data.
![Story 2:7](https://github.com/rindneremily/bikeshare/blob/main/images/Story%202:7.png)
This story includes two sheets from the module. It helps visualize the spots where bikers begin and end their trip.
## Summary
The main data points in these visualizations are the user type, gender, location, and time. For further analysis, creating visualizations that incorporate the usage of specific bikes by their bike ID could be useful for knowing which type of bike is most popular. Another visualization could include the popular stations that bikers are using.
